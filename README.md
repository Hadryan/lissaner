# Lissaner

![Preview](preview.gif)

An Android app that records audio from the past. Have you ever gone through a moment in your life
that you wish you had recorded? With this app you no longer have to remember to press start to
record. You don't even need to have the app open. This app provides a feature that many game
consoles have had for years. It allows you to save the past 30 minutes (or more) of your microphone
audio to a file.
