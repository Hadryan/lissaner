    <string name="recording_description">\n
        This app can record your microphone in the background while only keeping the last 30 minutes
        stored in memory. You can save those last 30 minutes to a file if you choose. This allows
        you to record spontaneous moments that you otherwise would have missed out.\n
        \n
        How to start recording\n
        Swipe right and you will find a page with a red button. Press start to begin recording. A
        notification should pop up. You can safely close the app and go on your normal day. As long
        as the notification is present, you can be rest assured that the app is still recording.
        You can open the app at any time to save the last 30 minutes to a file if something
        interesting happens.\n
        \n
        This project is open-source. That means the code can be read, studied and improved by other
        programmers. This app only records with your explicit consent and only stores audio files on
        your device, anyone able to understand the code will confirm that fact.\n
