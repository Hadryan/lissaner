        #### What is this?\n
        \n
        This app provides a feature that many game consoles have had for years. It keeps track of
        the last 30 minutes of audio recorded by your device\'s microphone. You can tap a button to
        save the audio to a file at any time. Now you don\'t have to miss out on once-in-a-lifetime
        real-life moments. Almost no processing power is required, just a lot of memory.\n
        \n
        \n
        #### How to start recording?\n
        You have to explicitly tell the app to start recording by pressing the big red button on
        top. On success, a notification will pop up. You can safely close the app
        and go on your normal day. As long as the notification is present, you can be
        rest assured that the app is still recording. You can open the app at any time to save the
        last 30 minutes to a file if something interesting happens.\n
        \n
        \n
        #### Can I trust this app?\n
        This app is open-source. That means its code can be read, studied and improved by other
        programmers. This app only records with your explicit consent and only stores audio files on
        your device, anyone able to understand the code will confirm that fact.\n
