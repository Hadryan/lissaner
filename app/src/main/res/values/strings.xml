        #### What is this?\n
        \n
        Lissaner records audio from the past. Have you ever gone through a moment in your life that
        you wish you had recorded? With Lissaner you no longer have to remember to press start
        to record. Lissaner brings a feature to Android devices that many game consoles have
        had for yearsâ€”it allows you to save the past 30 minutes (or more) of your microphone audio
        to a file.\n
        \n
        \n
        #### How do I use this?\n
        You must explicitly activate Lissaner by pressing the big red button. You will be prompted
        for permission to record on the first time. Once granted, a notification will pop up.
        This means that you can safely close the app and go on your normal day and as long as the
        notification is present you can be rest assured that Lissaner is ready to save the past.
        You can open Lissaner any time to save the audio to a file.\n
        \n
        \n
        #### Can I trust this app?\n
        This app is open-source. That means its source code can be read, studied and improved by
        other programmers. The app only records with your explicit consent and only stores audio
        files on your device. Anyone able to read code will confirm that.\n
