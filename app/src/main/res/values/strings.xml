    <string name="recording_description">Audio will be recorded to memory but only the last 30 minutes will be kept. Once you press the start button, a notification will pop up and the app will begin recording. You can safely close the app and go on your normal day. As long as the notification is present, you can be rest assured that the app is still recording in the background. You can open the app at any time to save the last 30 minutes to a file if something interesting happens.</string>
